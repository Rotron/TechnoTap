# TechnoTap

Techno Tap is a simple speed-dev iOS project created with a 2 week deadline.
Serverside code for the scoreboard is also included.

Available for download from the iOS app store here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/techno-tap/id986631346?mt=8
Live scoreboard: http://digitaldiscrepancy.com/TechnoTap/

Some key features of this app include custom UI, Audio consisting of Music and/or SFX, encryption, score keeping, and networking.

I've uploaded this code to serve as an example of some fairly simple coding tasks for less experienced developers, feel free to use snippets from this project in your own, but please do not release a duplicate app to the app store under a different name. If I find that someone had done this, I will contact Apple to have the duplicate app removed.
